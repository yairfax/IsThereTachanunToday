# Is There Tachanun Today?

For centuries, Jews have asked the same question over and over. _Is there Tachanun today?_ Can I go eat breakfast just a few minutes earlier? Oh and if it's a Monday or a Thursday, there's no greater _simcha_ than not saying tachanun. 

I present [IsThereTachanunToday.com], a website which answers this question for the _davener_ wondering if he or she can go straight onto Ashrei.
