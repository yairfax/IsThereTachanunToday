Young Dov Ber, the future Maggid of Mezritch, was the son of a poor melamed (teacher of young boys). A brilliant student, he went to Lemberg to study in the yeshivah of Rabbi Yaakov Yehoshua, the celebrated author of Penei Yehoshua. Dov Ber married young and earned a meager living as a teacher in a small village. There in the privacy of the modest hamlet, he perfected his knowledge of Torah and began to delve into the mysteries of Kabbalah. A gifted orator and original thinker, he served as maggid, or preacher, in Turshin, Koritz, and Dubno. Like most of the early masters of Chassidism, he was initially a fierce opponent of the new chassidic movement. Once when he was gravely ill, someone suggested that he visited the Baal Shem Tov, who was known as a healer. The encounter proved to be the turning point in Rabbi Dov Ber's life. He became the Baal Shem's ardent follower and the foremost emissary of his time for Chassidism. After the Baal Shem's death, the mantle of leadership passed to the Maggid (in which he served for 11 years until his death), who established Mezritch as the new center of Chassidut. Under his guidance the movement expanded rapidly, despite its numerous adversaries. His students fanned out through the entire region, tirelessly spreading the chassidic message of hope, consolation, and faith-and above all, joy in the service of God and the fulfillment of mitzvot. Some of the most illustrious Torah scholars and tzaddikim of that age were among the Maggid's students: Rabbi Shmelke of Nikolsburg and his brother Rabbi Pinchas Horowitz of Frankfurt, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev, Rabbi Nachum of Chernoble, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk and his brother Rabbi Zusha of Anapoli, Rabbi Zev Wolf of Zotamir, Rabbi Shlomo of Karlin, Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk, and many others.

After studying diligently under Baruch ben Neriah, the great teacher and prophet in Babylonia, Ezra returned to the land of Israel after the Babylonian exile (during which the Purim story occurred) and spearheaded the effort to construct the second Temple in Jerusalem. He was so enthusiastic and passionate about spreading the words of the Torah, that the rabbis said that Ezra was worthy for the Torah to have been given through him, had Moses not preceded him. Ezra and his beit din (court) instituted ten enactments, including the practice of reading the Torah on Monday and Thursday mornings and Shabbat afternoon. His extensive efforts to bring the Jewish people back to Torah continued as he founded several schools of Torah study. Ezra's death ended a 1000 years period of prophecy, which started, according to some opinions, with Matan Torah, the giving of the Torah to Moshe Rabbeinu, the first and greatest prophet at Mount Sinai in 2448, 1344 BCE.

As much as the books tell of the rebirth of the Jewish state, they also discuss the many hurdles that had to be overcome in that process. Of the many tens of thousands of Jews in Babylonia and neighboring countries, very few actually listened to Ezra's call to return to the Land of Israel, and the new community was sorrowfully small. Samaritans (Kutim) constantly attacked the Jews with arrows and swords, hoping to force them to give up the building. Eventually, the Samaritans slandered the Jews before the King, and asked him to force the Jews to stop building their Temple. It would be years before the work on the city walls and the Temple would continue. Nechemiah spent 12 years in the Land of Israel fixing the walls of Jerusalem and returning the people of Israel, each one to his city and to his inheritance.

When he was 13, Cordova was conquered by the invading Almohads, a fanatical Moslem sect. The family was forced to flee, wandering from place to place, ultimately settling in Fez, Morocco. In 1165 Rambam settled in Cairo, where he found asylum and religious freedom. At age 23 Rambam began writing his commentary on the Mishnah, Peirush Hamishnayot, in Arabic. When his brother David, who supported the entire family, perished at sea, Rambam began to study medicine and became physician of note. He was appointed as doctor to the court of Sultan Saladin. He used his influence to help his fellow Jews. In about 1170, Rambam began to write his monumental Misneh Torah, a compendium of all Jewish laws extracted from the Talmud and the works of the Geonim. Hundreds of thousands of Jews throughout the world daily study one or more chapters of Mishneh Torah. Rambam's Sefer HaMitzvot, written in Arabic, enumerates and elucidates the 613 precepts of the Torah.

Rambam demonstrates that there is no conflict between the two if the fundamentals of both are properly understood and interpreted. The book gave rise to controversy.

Rabbi Shalom Dovber founded the famous Lubavitch Yeshivah, Tomchei Tmimim, and appointed his son to be its executive director. His energetic and far-reaching public activities, his watchful defense of the rights of Russian Jewry and his constant fight against the local and central authorities aroused the displeasure of the Czarist regime at that time. His struggle came to a head in the summer of 1927, when the Rebbe was arrested and placed in solitary confinement in the notorious Spalerno prison in Leningrad. He was sentenced to death, but the timely intervention of leading foreign statesmen saved his life. Instead of being executed, he was banished to Kostroma, in the Urals, for three years. Giving way to further pressure by these statesmen, the authorities decided to release the Lubavitcher Rebbe. He was informed of this decision on his birthday, Tammuz 12. On March 19, 1940 the Lubavitcher Rebbe arrived in New York. Immediately upon his arrival, the Rebbe made it known that it was not for his own safety that he had made the trip to the United States, but because he had an important mission to fulfill during his sojourn there. This was to make America a Torah center, which would take the place of the ruined Jewish communities of Europe.

Rabbi Chaim was one of the noted rabbis of Egypt, a Torah sage who knew the revealed and the secret Torah. He was especially close to Rabbi Yosef Bagiliar, who studied with the Ari in Tzefat. This close friendship with R' Yosef brought him into contact with the Gurei Ari (students of the Ari - Rabbi Yitzchak Luria), so that he is numbered among them. R' Chaim Kapusi was dubbed the Wonder Worker because of a certain incident. He served as a dayan (a judge in a Jewish court). Once, his decision in a particular case caused people in the community to raise their eyebrows. They were convinced that he was in error and began talking evilly against him behind his back. \"Surely R' Chaim must have accepted bribery,\" they said. Shortly afterwards R' Chaim became blind. This was sure proof of his guilt, they claimed, since the Torah itself says that \"bribery blinds the eyes of the wise.\" These wicked insinuations reached the ears of the R' Chaim. He prayed to Hashem with all his heart, begging Him to remove the shameful stigma from him, since he knew that he was innocent. One day he declared in public, before the entire congregation, that people's suspicions were false and unfounded. \"If it is true that I accepted bribery,\" he exclaimed, \"then let me continue to be blind until the day I die. But if the allegations are false, let Hashem restore my sight!\" To the amazement of the entire kehillah , R' Chaim Kapusi's sight was suddenly and miraculously restored, then and there. From then on, they flocked to him to receive his blessing. R' Chaim passed away at the ripe age of 91. He was buried in the Jewish cemetery of Cairo and his grave site is considered a sacred site. The anniversary of his death is a day of solemn celebrations. People gather at his graveside to pray and light candles.
